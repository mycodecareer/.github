# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

By default, the past versions will not be supported and security fixes will result in a new version release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a security vulnerability is found, please submit a ticket on the corresponding repo.

To submit a ticket, click on the `Security` tab, then navigate to the `Advisories` section, and submit a new `Secruity Advisory`.

The team will review the advisory and if it is deemed valid, the team will submit a fix within 120 days.  After this 120 day window, or once the fix has been merged, the author of the `Security Advisory` is welcome to share their findings more broadly.
